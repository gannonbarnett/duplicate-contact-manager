# DuplicateContactManager
My iPhone 12 was duplicating *some* contacts randomly. I let it fester past manual intervention (~20% of my 
contacts were unique before this app), thus I spent a Saturday making this app to fix my phone.
This app can be loaded locally (not published) and allows users to detect and delete duplicate contacts. 
*Nothing smart re which version to delete, so if you really care, manual is probably still best...* 

Side note: default iOS contact perms allow read *and write, without user confirmation*.
