# DuplicateContactManager
My iPhone 12 was duplicating *some* contacts randomly. After happening a few times
I had too many contacts with 8x identical copies. I found a few posts here and there
about this behavior, but no good solutions. This app can be loaded locally (not published)
and allows users to detect and delete duplicate contacts. *Nothing smart with which version to 
delete, so if you really care, manual is probably still best...*
